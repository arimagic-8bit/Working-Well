# Working Well

### Description

Working Well is a responsive web app created to help people stay focused on their tasks or activities. To manage the working and rest time I will use the [Pomodoro technique]([https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9cnica_Pomodoro](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/TÃ©cnica_Pomodoro)). 

### User stories

**Signup**: As an anon I can sign up in the platform so that I can start using the app.

**Login**: As a user I can login to the platform so that I can start using the app.

**Logout**: As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.

**Set task/activity**: As a user I can create a task or activity I want to focus on and set my working and rest time.

### Backlog

- Add relaxing music when doing the task/activity.
- Add different time managing techniques that the user can choose.
